##  This is a prototype for getting the sizes of the available disks and memory
##  and then automatically generating disk partition sizes that will accommodate
##  a new Linux installation on that disk

#  Basic idea:  1) list disks with sizes  2) list available memory size  3) do you want to hibernate?
#  4) do you want LVM?    5) calculate swap
